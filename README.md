# Customer List Technical Exercise

## Overview

This application consists of a NextJS front-end and Ruby on Rails API.

NextJS is a React framework that offers several advantages over other React toolchains like Create React App or Gatsby. I particularly appreciate the server-side rendering capabilities and default route-based code splitting of NextJS. It's very easy to get started with and doesn't require much effort up front for these additional benefits.

Rails is incredibly convenient for creating REST APIs. Given the simple initial requirements for the customers endpoint, I determined that a single JSON REST endpoint (`/customers`) would be sufficient.

## Getting Started

Start the application from the project root using:

`docker-compose up`

Then access the app at localhost:3000.
